# LyricPlaylistGenerator
The Lyric Playlist Generator is a Python script that helps generate playlists based on specific themes, moods, or genres using lyrics as input. This script utilizes the Genius.com API to search for songs that match the given search query and then randomly selects a subset of those songs to create a playlist.

The generated playlist allows users to discover songs that align with their desired themes, moods, or genres. By analyzing the lyrics and leveraging the vast database of songs available on Genius.com, the script provides a personalized and unique playlist experience.
